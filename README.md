## Basic Autonomous Navigation System for Indoor Robots
The project aims to advance indoor robot navigation and object recognition through machine learning. Focusing on enabling robots to identify and navigate around indoor objects accurately, it leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spatial understanding, adaptive learning for dynamic navigation, and deep learning-enhanced Simultaneous Localization and Map Building (SLAM) for precision. The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset with high-resolution images and sensor data from diverse indoor environments, including RGB and depth sensors, Lidar, and ultrasonic readings. This data trains models to recognize and classify various objects, enhancing robot autonomy in real-world applications. The approach involves fine-tuning pre-trained CNNs like ResNet or VGG on custom datasets for improved object recognition accuracy. Through real-world feedback and iterative enhancements, the project seeks to create a robust system capable of sophisticated spatial understanding and precise object identification. This would significantly improve indoor robots' operational capabilities, offering broad applicability from home assistance to inventory management, by adapting the technology to meet different environmental requirements and scenarios.
